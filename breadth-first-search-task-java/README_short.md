# Breadth-first search

## Purpose

The following coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

* The Breadth-first search approach to graph traversal

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Calculating the number of connectivity components in a given undirected graph
* Checking whether a given undirected graph has any cycles
* Finding all the distances from a given graph vertex to the other vertices
