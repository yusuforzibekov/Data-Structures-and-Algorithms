# Depth-first search

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

* DFS traversal

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Checking to see if a (v, u)-path exists in a directed graph
* Checking to see if an undirected connected graph is bipartite
* Finding the length of the longest eligible path in a directed acyclic graph
