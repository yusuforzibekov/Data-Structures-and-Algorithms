     * Returns a pair in which the first value is the sum of the all-pairs shortest paths between 
     *   all connected vertices and the second is the number of disconnected pairs of vertices in 
     *   an undirected weighted graph.
     *
     * The weight of (u,v)-edge represents the distance between 'u' and 'v' and vice versa.
     *
     * Edges are stored as an adjacency matrix, where 0 means no edge and a positive value indicates 
     *   the presence of an edge and reflects its weight.
     * 
     * The expected algorithm complexity is O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices.
     * 
     * For example, you have a graph with three vertices from 0 to 2 and the following adjacency matrix:
     *   [[0, 10, 5], [10, 0, 6], [5, 6, 0]]
     * The expected result is (42, 0).
     * 
     * @param n number of vertices in the graph, vertices are enumerated from 0 to n-1.
     * @param adjacencyMatrix adjacency matrix with weights.
     * @return the sum of the all-pairs shortest paths between all connected vertices
     *   and the number of disconnected pairs of vertices.
