# The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

* The LPS array
* The KMP algorithm for matching strings
* Applying the KMP algorithm in practice

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Building an LPS array for a given string
* Implementing the KMP algorithm
* Checking whether a given string is a tandem repeat
