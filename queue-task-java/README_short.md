# Queue

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

* The default `Fifo` interface (the alias to `java.util.Queue` interface from jdk)
* `Fifo` that is implemented using two stacks
* Using the `Fifo` data structure in practice

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Implementing the default `Fifo` interface
* Implementing `Fifo` using two stacks
* Calculating the number of islands in a grid
* Knight traversal
