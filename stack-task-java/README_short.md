# Stack

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

* The default `Lifo` interface (the alias to `java.util.Stack` class from jdk) 
* Adjusting the `Lifo` data structure to support more complex operations
* Using the `Lifo` data structure in practice

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Implementing the default `Lifo` interface
* Validating expressions in parentheses
* Adjusting `Lifo` to support the `getMinimum` operation
* Reverse Polish notation (RPN) parsing
